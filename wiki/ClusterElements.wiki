#summary data format, clustering result

= ClusterElements =

A cluster element is our data-format that holds the result of an [Analysis] on a specific cycle. To deal with the hierarchical structure of our results it contains further cluster elements. A cluster element consists of the name, the sentiment, a list of further subcluster elements, and a list of Tweets that refer to it.
