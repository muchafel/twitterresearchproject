= ClusterElements =

A Cluster Element is our data-format that holds the result of a [Analysis] on a specific cycle. To deal with the hierarchical structure of our results it contains (sub)-ClusterElements. A ClusterElement consits of the name, the sentiment, a list of (sub)-ClusterElements and a list of tweets that refer to it.
