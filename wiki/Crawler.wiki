#summary collecting Tweets

To collect some sample Tweets we have written a Crawler using the [http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html Twitter4J] library. The Crawler is a simple server-side application which listens to the Twitter stream and saves the incoming Tweets on certain Hashtags as a JSON file. Because our main goal is to analyze Tweets regarding shows that go on TV in a weekly turn the Crawler groups the crawled Tweets by week which means at the end there is one JSON file per Hashtag per week, which goes into the [Analysis]. The Crawler can be configured manually by the user which means the user can add or delete Hashtags on which the Crawler listens (s. [UserGuidelines] for more).
