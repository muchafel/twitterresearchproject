= KeyphraseExtraction=

In order to compress the tweets further we try to extract words and phrases that describe the sense of each tweet. For this reason we use a co-occurence-graph-based approach to detect and select keyphrases. First we create a co-occurence graph by using a sliding window approach with a size of 4. We start with a graph with a node for every word and adding an edge between two edges that co-occur inside the moving window. The effect of this procedure on the german example sentence "In einer Anti-Spam Klage wird behauptet, dass Utah Anti-Spam Regelungen verletzt. Das Vorgehen von Utah bezüglich der Anti-Spam Gesetze könnte die Bahn für neue Regelungen mit Telekommunikationsanbietern ebnen." is shown below:

Then the most connected nodes are selected as keywords. Because there could be also keyprahses each keyword is checked for adjacent nodes that have a high rank, too.
If we found such a compound of two adjacent words that are both highly-connected we choose the compound as keyphrase.

In the example sentence the keyphrases "Utah Anti-Spam Regelungen, Bahn, Telekommunikationsanbietern, Anti-Spam Gesetze" would be chosen.
