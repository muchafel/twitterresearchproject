An extension to [https://code.google.com/p/twitterresearchproject/wiki/Overview Overview - Process]

The flow from a tweet to its visualization:

 # The !PostCollector (!TwitterCrawler via [http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html Twitter4J]) grabs tweets in *JSON* format in the rawdata folder with a timestamp via !TimeStamp class (you can change that with the project_config.xml): *files/rawdata/tweets/hashtag/yyyyMMddHHmmss_hashtag.json*
 # The JSON is read out by a !FileReader and a !PostConverter converts it into the demanded *Post* format to reduce overhead and ensure independence from api specific formats
 # The *!PostProvider* hands the Post over to the Analysis and its result is saved in the CAS (you can change that by project_config.xml -> serializedCases): *files/hashtag/yyyyMMddHHmmss/yyyyMMddHHmmss_i.ser*
 # The serialized results become clustered into *ClusterElements* with a Sentiment and these are saved in: *files/serializedClusterElements/hashtag/yyyyMMdd.ser*
 # The ClusterElements are called via the RMI interface but they have to be merged into a *JSON format* ([ https://code.google.com/p/twitterresearchproject/wiki/Visualization details]), which turned out to be very much faster on server-side with the org.JSON lib instead of the gwt.client.json lib
 # The JSON string is passed to the Visualization and parsed into !JavaScript objects so the outer js libs (Google Visualization API) can work with them
