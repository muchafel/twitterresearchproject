#summary sentiment, keyphrase extraction, spelling, scope, semantic information

=Limitations & Outlook=

To gain insight in the huge amount of unstructured social media data this project uses a set of NLP-steps that were selected by theoretical (what should work best?) and practical issues (like license, availability in German, effort of implementation). In addition the unconventional use of language in the environment of social media causes some troubles to the adaption of best-practice approaches. This causes the fact, that the performance of the different steps could be improved further.

=Sentiment=
Our sentiment approach doesn’t take any context of words into account and relies just on the association of the words in the WebT1-corpus. It misses any syntactic dependencies in sentences that could effect the sentiment. Therefore it isn’t even capable of realizing that a “not” in front of an adjective could turn around the sentiment of the meaning. In the future there should be a mechanism that is capable of such dependencies by using syntactical parsing. Because tweets often don’t use “correct” syntax, simple handcrafted rules (like “turn sentiment around after not”) should be added as fallback. In addition sentiment is highly related to the domain. To face this it is maybe worthy to compute the sentiment lexicon on a twitter-corpus (if a big one should be available).
A further improvement could be an analysis that computes sentiment for aspects of the statements. Our approach sums up the sentiment of the whole tweet and only finds the sentiment of the whole tweet. A better approach would be to examine different aspects of the tweet (e.g. the extracted key phrases) and assign sentiment to them. 

=Key Phrase Extraction=
Our approach is co-occurrence-graph based. Main advantage of this kind of approach is that they can take big context into account. Because Tweets consists of maximal 140 characters, the small context prevents the context advantage from generating real value. So it often brings nearly the same results as a simple noun selection would bring. An alternative that would work for small contexts would be a noun phrase selection by using a chunker. Unfortunately we didn’t find a chunker that is capable of German, under a free license and easy to integrate into our set-up. In the future this should be tackled.
